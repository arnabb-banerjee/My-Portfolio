            <!-- Q1 -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <p class="fw-semibold text-warning mb-1">Q1: Arnab, thank you for joining us! Tell us, how did your musical journey begin?</p>
                <p class="text-light">Arnab Banerjee: Thank you for having me! My journey started pretty organically. I grew up in a family that loves music, and I was always surrounded by melodies from a young age. I began learning classical music during my school years, which laid a strong foundation. Over time, I found myself drawn to Bengali folk and Rabindra Sangeet, and thatâ€™s when I knew music would be my path.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Q2 -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <p class="fw-semibold text-warning mb-1">Q2: Your music beautifully blends tradition with modern elements. How do you approach this balance?</p>
                <p class="text-light">Arnab: I think music is a living thingâ€”it evolves. I respect and cherish the roots, whether itâ€™s folk tunes or Tagoreâ€™s compositions, but I also want to connect with todayâ€™s listeners. So I experiment with arrangements and sounds while keeping the soul intact. Itâ€™s about creating a bridge between generations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <p class="fw-semibold text-warning mb-1">Q3: Which artists or experiences have influenced you the most?</p>
                <p class="text-light">Arnab: There are so many, but Iâ€™d say legendary singers like Hemanta Mukherjee and Manna Dey inspire me deeply. Their emotion and technique are unmatched. Also, performing live and engaging with audiences taught me the power of authenticity and connection.</p>
            </div>

                <p class="text-light">Arnab: Itâ€™s been incredible. Social media has allowed me to reach people beyond geographical boundaries. I love interacting with my listeners, hearing their stories, and sometimes even collaborating on ideas. It keeps me grounded and motivated.</p>
            </div>

Iâ€™m also planning to collaborate with some amazing composers. My goal is to keep growing as an artist and bring meaningful music to everyone.</p>
